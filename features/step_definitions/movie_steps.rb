# Add a declarative step here for populating the DB with movies.

Given /the following movies exist/ do |movies_table|
  movies_table.hashes.each do |movie|
    # each returned element will be a hash whose key is the table header.
    # you should arrange to add that movie to the database here.
    Movie.create!(movie)
  end
end

Then /(.*) seed movies should exist/ do | n_seeds |
  expect(Movie.count).to eq n_seeds.to_i
end

# Make sure that one string (regexp) occurs before or after another one
#   on the same page

Then /I should see "(.*)" before "(.*)"/ do |e1, e2|
  expect(page.body.index(e1)).to be < page.body.index(e2)
end

# Make it easier to express checking or unchecking several boxes at once
#  "When I uncheck the following ratings: PG, G, R"
#  "When I check the following ratings: G"


When /I (un)?check the following ratings: (.*)/ do |uncheck, rating_list|
  # HINT: use String#split to split up the rating_list, then
  #   iterate over the ratings and reuse the "When I check..." or
  #   "When I uncheck..." steps in lines 89-95 of web_steps.rb

# Part 2, Step 3
Then /^I should (not )?see the following movies: (.*)$/ do |no, movie_list|
  # Take a look at web_steps.rb Then /^(?:|I )should see "([^"]*)"$/
